      <h3>Solitary and other forms of isolated confinement are <span class="red">inhumane, counterproductive, and unsafe.</span></h3>
      <p>Organized by <a href="http://nycaic.org/" target="_blank">NYCAIC</a>, the #HALTsolitary campaign aims to <span class="red">reduce the use of solitary confinement</span> and other forms of extreme isolation in state prisons and local jails in New York.</p>
      <p>The HALT Solitary Confinement Act (A.2500 / S.1623) is now <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s1623" target="_blank">in committee</a> in the NY State Senate. <span class="red">Now is the time to contact your state officials and urge them to pass #HALTsolitary into law.</span></p>

      <h4>facts</h4>
      <h3><span class="red">Over 30% of all suicides in NY prisons</span> from 2014-2016 took place in solitary, though only 6% to 8% of all people in prison were in solitary.</h3>
      <p>People in isolated confinement in NY State spend <span class="red">22 to 24 hours a day locked in a cell the size of an elevator,</span> alone or with one other person. They may be permitted 1-2 hours to exercise alone in a cage; they <span class="red">do not receive any meaningful programs or therapy,</span> and often cannot make phone calls.</p>
      <p>The sensory deprivation, lack of normal human interaction, and extreme idleness can lead to intense suffering and severe psychological damage. Isolated confinement <span class="red">fails to address the underlying causes of problematic behavior,</span> and often exacerbates that behavior as people deteriorate psychologically, physically, and socially.</p>

      <h4>facts</h4>
      <h3>People are regularly held in isolation in NYS for <span class="red">periods of time that amount to torture.</span></h3>
      <p>Most people sent to isolation in NY prisons spend months or years there; <span class="red">some individuals have been in solitary confinement in New Yorkâ€™s prisons for more than two decades.</span></p>
      <p><em>The entire United Nations General Assembly has denounced solitary exceeding 15 days.</em></p>
      <p>In 2015, the US government voted for, and the entire United Nations adopted, the Mandela Rules, which <span class="red">prohibit any person from being held in solitary beyond 15 days.</span> Colorado has implemented a 15-day limit on solitary and reduced the number of people in solitary from 1,500 to 18.</p>
      <p><span class="red">New York currently places no limit</span> on the total time a person can spend in isolated confinement.</span></p>
