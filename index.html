      <h3>Solitary and other forms of isolated confinement are <span class="red">inhumane, counterproductive, and unsafe.</span></h3>
      <p>Organized by <a href="http://nycaic.org/" target="_blank">NYCAIC</a>, <span class="red">the #HALTsolitary campaign aims to reduce the use of solitary confinement</span> and other forms of extreme isolation in state prisons and local jails in New York.</p>
      <p>The HALT Solitary Confinement Act (A.2500 / S.1623) is now <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s1623" target="_blank">in committee</a> in the NY State Senate. <span class="red">Now is the time to contact your state officials and urge them to pass #HALTsolitary into law.</span></p>
      <p>You can <span class="red">learn more about the #HALTsolitary campaign by reading our primer,</span> or simply click below to generate an email to your NY State officials.</p>

      <h4>Facts</h4>
      <h3><span class="red">Over 30% of all suicides in NY prisons</span> from 2014-2016 took place in solitary, though only 6% to 8% of all people in prison were in solitary.</h3>
      <p>People in isolated confinement in NY State spend <span class="red">22 to 24 hours a day locked in a cell the size of an elevator,</span> alone or with one other person. They may be permitted 1-2 hours to exercise alone in a cage; they <span class="red">do not receive any meaningful programs or therapy,</span> and often cannot make phone calls.</p>
      <p>The sensory deprivation, lack of normal human interaction, and extreme idleness can lead to intense suffering and severe psychological damage. Isolated confinement <span class="red">fails to address the underlying causes of problematic behavior,</span> and often exacerbates that behavior as people deteriorate psychologically, physically, and socially.</p>

      <h4>Facts</h4>
      <h3>People are regularly held in isolation in NYS for <span class="red">periods of time that amount to torture.</span></h3>
      <p>Most people sent to isolation in NY prisons spend months or years there; <span class="red">some individuals have been in solitary confinement in New York’s prisons for more than two decades.</span></p>
      <p>In 2015, the US government voted for, and the entire United Nations adopted, the Mandela Rules, which <span class="red">prohibit any person from being held in solitary beyond 15 days.</span> Colorado has implemented a 15-day limit on solitary and reduced the number of people in solitary from 1,500 to 18.</p>
      <p><span class="red">New York currently places no limit</span> on the total time a person can spend in isolated confinement.</span></p>

      <h4>Facts</h4>
      <h3>There are far too many people in isolation, <span class="red">disproportionately people of color.</span></h3>
      <p>Thousands of people are in isolated confinement in NYS prisons and hundreds more in local jails each day, and <span class="red">tens of thousands each year.</span></p>
      <p><span class="red">Black people represent about 13% of all people in NYS,</span> but represent 50% of those incarcerated in NYS, and 60% of people held in long-term solitary confinement units in NY.</p>

      <h4>Facts</h4>
      <h3>Even <span class="red">particularly vulnerable people</span> are held in isolated confinement.</h3>
      <p><span class="red">Young people and people with mental illness</span> are disproportionately likely to be put in isolation.</p>
      <p>More than 800 people on the <a href="https://omh.ny.gov/" target="_blank">Office of Mental Health</a> caseload remain in solitary confinement each day. <span class="red">Pregnant women, new mothers, elderly people, and people with severe physical disabilities</span> are held in isolation in NYS.</p>
      <p><span class="red">Members of the LGBTI community</span> are often placed in solitary purportedly for their own protection and have suffered additional staff abuse while in isolation.</p>

      <h4>Facts</h4>
      <h3>Current processes are arbitrary and unfair, with <span class="red">insufficiently trained staff, and little accountability.</span></h3>
      <p>Corrections officers are not sufficiently trained to address people’s needs or problematic behavior; as a result, <span class="red">the default response is to write a disciplinary ticket for any alleged rule violation.</span></p>
      <p><span class="red">95% of people charged with these rule violations are found guilty.</span> These processes occur within the closed prison system, with little public reporting by <a href="https://doccs.ny.gov/" target="_blank">DOCCS</a>.</p>

    <section id="8">
      <h4>Key Mechanisms</h4>
      <h3>#HALTsolitary <span class="red">creates more humane and effective alternatives</span> to isolated confinement.</h3>
      <p>Any person separated from general population for more than 15 consecutive days must be in a separate secure Residential Rehabilitation Unit (RRU) – a rehabilitative & therapeutic unit providing <span class="red">programs, therapy, and support to address underlying needs and causes of behavior,</span> with 6 hours per day of out-of-cell programming plus one hour of out-of-cell recreation.</p>

    <section id="9">
      <h4>Key Mechanisms</h4>
      <h3>#HALTsolitary <span class="red">ends long-term isolated confinement.</span></h3>
      <p>A person may be held in isolated confinement for <span class="red">no more than 15 consecutive days nor 20 days total in any 60 day period.</span> At these limits, a person must be released or diverted to the alternative RRU with more out-of-cell time, programs, and therapy.</p>

    <section id="10">
      <h4>Key Mechanisms</h4>
      <h3>#HALTsolitary <span class="red">restricts criteria for placement</span> in isolated confinement or RRUs.</h3>
      <p>A person can only be placed in segregated confinement for more than 3 days and up to 15 days, or be placed in an RRU, if the person is <span class="red">found to have engaged in more serious acts</span> of physical injury, forced sexual acts, extortion, coercion, inciting serious disturbance, procuring deadly weapons or dangerous contraband, or escape.</p>

      <h4>Key Mechanisms</h4>
      <h3>#HALTsolitary <span class="red">bans special populations</span> from isolated confinement.</h3>
      <p>The department can never place in isolated confinement any person: <span class="red">21 years or younger; 55 years or older; with a physical, mental, or medical disability; who is pregnant; or who is a new mother or caring for a child while inside.</span></p>

      <h4>Key Protections</h4>
      <h3>#HALTsolitary <span class="red">enhances due process protections</span> before placement in isolated confinement or RRUs.</h3>
      <p>For example, a person may have <span class="red">access to legal representation</span> by pro bono attorneys, law students, or approved paralegals at hearings that could result in isolated confinement.</p>

      <h4>Key Protections</h4>
      <h3>#HALTsolitary <span class="red">creates mechanisms for release</span> from RRUs.</h3>
      <p>#HALTsolitary requires <span class="red">meaningful review at least every 60 days</span> to determine if a person shall be released from a residential rehabilitation unit. Also, a person <span class="red">must be released if their disciplinary sentence runs out;</span> and, a person <span class="red">must be released after one year</span> if they have not already been released, unless there are specified exceptional circumstances and approval by the corrections commissioner.</p>

      <h4>Key Protections</h4>
      <h3>#HALTsolitary <span class="red">covers all categories of people</span> who currently face isolated confinement.</h3>
      <p>The bill applies to <span class="red">disciplinary confinement, administrative segregation, and protective custody,</span> while excluding medical/mental health isolation. It covers people in Special Housing Units (SHU), S-block, Keeplock, and/or any isolation beyond 17 hours per day. It also applies to all state prisons and county jails in New York State.</p>
